Haven't been here in years! Fantastic service and the food was delicious! Definetly will be a frequent flyer! Francisco was very attentive
Sorry OG, but you just lost some loyal customers. Horrible service, no smile or greeting just attitude. The breadsticks were stale and burnt, appetizer was cold and the food came out before the salad.
I chose two items from the new menu, the shrimp scampi and the shrimp and chicken carbonara, both with my favourite soup and some warm breadsticks. The soup was good, as always.
